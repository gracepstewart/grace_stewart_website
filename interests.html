    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <ul>Crafting</ul>
    <li>It's fun to make things. I like to draw, sew, dye, sculpt, and craft in general.</li>
    <ul>Cross Counry</ul>
    <li>I have been running cross country since freshman year. It is very difficult, but also very rewarding. It makes me feel srng and like I am in control of my life. Also, the people who do cross country are the best, and I am no exception.
    </li>
    <ul>Veggie Grill Enthusiast</ul>
    <li>I discovered Veggie Grill a year ago. It is really, really good--even if you aren't vegetarian. I suggest the SantaFeCrispyChicken.</li>
    <ul>Reading</ul>
    <li> I like reading because, like movies, books tell stories, but unlike movies, books make you smarter. Also, reading is relaxing. </li>
    <ul>Track and Field</ul>
    <li>Track is a little like cross country, but shorter distance and in the spring.</li>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Go to UCLA or UC Berkely</dt>
        <dd>I really love these colleges, and I have worked very hard in High School in the hopes that I will one day attend a college I love. I love these colleges because they are both well respected, beautiful, and smell good.</dd>
        <dt>Learn How to Speak Spanish Better</dt>
        <dd>I'm curretly taking my 4th year of Spanish, but I'm far from fluent. I feel like I shold know how to speak it better because many people in California only speak Spanish.</dd>
        <dt>Have a Weekly Craft Night</dt>
        <dd>I love crafting, and my friends love crafting. I am looking foreward to a time in my life where I am organized enough to make that a regular gathering.</dt>
