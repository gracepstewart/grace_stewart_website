    <p>I was born on March 23rd, 2002, with my sister Sophie, in Santa Rosa, California. I have and older brother named Eli, who is 20 and attends UC Berkely. My mom, Juliana, and dad, Joe, are both 49 years old and love farming and projects. My early life was full of stuffed animals and crafting. I used to be a lot shorter, but time passed and I grew more. Fun Fact: I'm taller than my mom! She hates that. When you first meet me, you may think I'm pretty quiet. But once you get to know me, you will see that I'm pretty loud. I work hard in school and do my best to treat others as well as possible. Enjoy!</P>

    <h2 class=center>Stories</h2>
    <p>I have lots of stories, most of which I have forgotten. I used to ride my dog like a horse when I was little, and I used the word "ourchother" to describe me and my sister. Oh, also, I was homeschooled for a year. We got to birth 7 baby goats, travel to Thailand, and garden a lot. That was fun. Here is our blog from that year. <a href="http://stewyurt.blogspot.com/"> Stewyurt Blog</a> This summer, I went to Panama for 6 weeks and lived with a family. I learned a lot of Spanish and it was amazing. Also, I have a goat! </p>
