    <h1>GRACE's Background</h1>
    <h2>Me</h2>
    <p>I was born on March 23rd, 2002, with my sister Sophie, in Santa Rosa, California. I have and older brother named Eli, who is 20 and attends UC Berkely. My mom, Juliana, and dad, Joe, are both 49 years old and love farming and projects. </P>
    <h2>Stories</h2>
    <p>I have lots of stories, most of which I have forgotten. I used to ride my dog like a horse when I was little, and I used the word "ourchother" to describe me and my sister. Oh, also, I was homeschooled for a year. We got to birth 7 baby goats, travel to Thailand, and garden a lot. That was fun. </p>
